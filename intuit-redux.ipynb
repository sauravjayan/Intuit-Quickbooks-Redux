    "Please complete this python notebook with your group by answering the questions in `intuit-redux.pdf`. Create a Notebook and HTML file with all your results and comments and push both the Notebook and HTML file to GitLab when your team is done. All results MUST be reproducible (i.e., the TA and I must be able to recreate the HTML file from the Jupyter Notebook without changes or errors). This means that you should NOT use any python-packages that are not part of the rsm-msba-spark docker container.\n",

    "This is the second group assignment for MGTA 455 and you will be using Git and GitLab. If two people edit the same file at the same time you could get what is called a \"merge conflict\". This is not something serious but you should realize that Git will not decide for you who's change to accept so the team-lead will have to determine the edits to use. To avoid merge conflicts, **always** \"pull\" changes to the repo before you start working on any files. Then, when you are done, save and commit your changes, and then push them to GitLab. Make \"pull first\" a habit!\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple people are going to work on the assignment at the same time I recommend you work in different notebooks. You can then `%run ...`  these \"sub\" notebooks from the main assignment file. You can seen an example of this in action below for the `model1.ipynb` notebook\n",
